Working with Finnish National Gallery API

Background information:

Finnish National Gallery consist of three museums: Ateneum Art Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma and Sinebrychoff Art Museum.
As stated by Finnish National Gallery’s website: “Responsibility for the augmentation and management of the collection is divided between 
three museums. The Sinebrychoff Art Museum houses old international art from the 14th to the early 19th century, the Ateneum Art Museum 
has Finnish art up to 1969 as well as international art from the 19th and 20th centuries, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma is 
responsible for Finnish and international art from 1960 onwards.”. The collections include works of art, objects and archive materials.
Art historical archive material is stored and managed by the National Gallery´s Collections Department. Finnish National Gallery offers 
its digitised collections online and their API is publicly available. Collections are also available through Finna and Europeana and 
through their APIs.

My focus has been on making visualisations about the different acquisition types found from the FNG API and about the division of digitised
entries between the museums. My main goal was to find out how many items have been digitised by the Finnish National Gallery and by each 
museum individually. These visualisations will give some insight about the way some of the digitised items have entered the collections and
since each museum has its own focus ranging from old masters to contemporary art, it can possibly tell us something about the digitisation 
priorities of National Gallery.

During this project I have produced 3 different visualisations of the dataset and analysed them in detail. More detailed description with
visualisations can be found from FNGAPI_Analysis.docx and FNGAPI_Analysis.pdf.I have included the images in jpg format and the dataset 
Excel-file named as Kokoelmat_final.xlsx as well as the bits of code for that was used in making it as well as the JSON-file downloaded
from the Finnish National Gallery's website.
